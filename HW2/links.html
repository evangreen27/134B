		<h2>Internal</h2>
		<p>
		Clicking on links in this section are internal links.
		This means that you are visiting a different page, but still on the site.
		Try clicking on these links to visit different pages on this website:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="links_test/link1.html">Internal Link 1</a></li>
			<li><a href="links_test/link2.html">Internal Link 2</a></li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section id="external">
		<h2>External</h2>
		<p>
		The following links will lead you outside of this website. These are called
		external links. Once you leave, you won't be on this site anymore. Let's
		give it a try! The cats have told us to give you some options of various
		destinations to visit. Don't worry, they should be safe. That is, unless
		you are allergic to search engines! (Definitely not allergic to cats!)
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.bing.com">Bing</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a></li>
		</ul>

	<section id="within">
		<h2>Within</h2>
		<p>
			This cat wants to tell you something. Did you know that you can navigate
			up and down this page? For example, click the link below to navigate back
			to the top of this page, without even leaving this page at all! This will
			take you back to the Homepage section. Then, try using the Navigation Bar
			to bring yourself back to this Within section!
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#homepage">Take me to Homepage at the top of this page!</a></li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section id="othersection">
		<h2>Other</h2>
		<p>
		By now, you might want to visit a particular page. On that particular page,
		you might think to yourself, meow, you already know where you want to be,
		ON that page! Well lucky for you, we can take you there. If you click the
		link below, this cat promises to take you to Link 3, under a section called
		"Meowing 101". Try it out!
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="links_test/link3.html#meowing101">Take me to a section within some other page!</a></li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section id="imagemap">
		<h2>Image Map</h2>
		<p>
		Look, we get it. We are all cats inside. On some days, we feel like cats. On
		other days, we literally *are* cats. Well luckily for you, today is the day
		to experience how awesome cats are. By clicking on different sections of the
		cat image below, you will end up at different university websites. Why?
		Because cats love education. Also remember to use your back button to come
		back after you leave.
		</p>
		<p>
			Something tells me the left side of the cat likes the UC System. I think
			the right side of this cat likes the CSU System...

	<p>Because every page we host needs to have a link to the HTML validator
	showing the current syntax state of the page, you can find the link to
	the validator to this page here:
