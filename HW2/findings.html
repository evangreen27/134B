	<h1>Top Ten Findings</h1>
  <ol reversed>
  <li>The &lt;link&gt; element represents a connection between two resources. Something that confused us initially is that we didn&rsquo;t understand what the difference between using the element itself meant, and the difference between other elements like &lt;a&gt; or using &ldquo;href&rdquo; inside of &lt;link&gt;.</li>
  <li>When trying to find a way to divide up the website into different sections, we found there were 2 things that could be of use: &lt;div&gt; and &lt;section&gt;. We were initially confused about the difference, but decided that &lt;section&gt; is better for giving the website logical section names for navigating to, whereas &lt;div&gt; could even be potentially arbitrary.</li>
  <li>We didn&rsquo;t know there were different types of &ldquo;links&rdquo;. In general, we were under the impression that all &ldquo;links&rdquo; on the web were just places that navigate different websites. In learning about this, we found out that internal links are those that take you to places within the same domain, and external links would link you outside of the website. For example, clicking on a link that takes you to Google from our website, is considered an external link.</li>
  <li>One thing we are still not clear on is why there is a whole tag dedicated to &lt;nav&gt;. It doesn&rsquo;t seem very intuitive to have an entire tag represent this, and we&rsquo;re not entirely sure why you would want to wrap it up in this tag, when you can just use headers or section tags, or even divs, to represent the navigation bar.</li>
  <li>We were initially confused about how onmousewheel differs from onscroll. We then found that the difference is that the former only fires when you physically scroll using your mouse or trackpad. Onscroll fires as well but also when scrolling with the arrow keys, the page up/down keys, etc.</li>
  <li>There were more event attributes that sounded like they do the same thing to us. After researching these, we found that some events, like onmouseover and onmouseout also fire when their child element gets triggered. This is what distinguishes them from similar event attributes, respectively onmouseenter and onmouseleave. Other than that, they actually do the same thing.</li>
	<li>On a matter of HTML in general, we found that it was confusing to note that HTML itself talks bout the structure and content of the page, while CSS is for styling and presentation, typically. When we had to use the style tag, we ran into some trouble when trying to decide if this was the right thing for the job, because style seems opposite of HTML, so it was weird that they have it available to use.</li>
	<li>Regarding the ID attributes, one problem we were confused about was why our page would not validate. It turns out, that the ID attribute cannot have a space between words, that is, cannot contain whitespace. After we fixed it by replacing it with an underscore, it validated. We are still kind of perplexed why it has to be like that.</li>
	<li>A major part of the project we were concerned about was when the documentation for HTML said that it was obsolete, but the browser still rendered it onto the page. We watched a youtube video later on that explained how although there is an HTML specification document, many browsers often support different things, and thus things that work for one browser might not work for the other. In general, it sounds like a total headache to try to plan for so many browsers. We wonder how developers are able to solve this problem.</li>
	<li>We were curious what would happen if the tabindex attribute skipped a number or didnâ€™t start with 1. When we tested this out, the browser ignored this issue and started from the lowest index and continued on in order with the next highest index.</li>
  </ol>

	<p>Because every page we host needs to have a link to the HTML validator
	showing the current syntax state of the page, you can find the link to
	the validator to this page here:
