	<h1>Top Ten Findings</h1>
  <ol reversed>
  <li>The &lt;link&gt; element represents a connection between two resources. Something that confused us initially is that we didn&rsquo;t understand what the difference between using the element itself meant, and the difference between other elements like &lt;a&gt; or using &ldquo;href&rdquo; inside of &lt;link&gt;.</li>
  <li>When trying to find a way to divide up the website into different sections, we found there were 2 things that could be of use: &lt;div&gt; and &lt;section&gt;. We were initially confused about the difference, but decided that &lt;section&gt; is better for giving the website logical section names for navigating to, whereas &lt;div&gt; could even be potentially arbitrary.</li>
  <li>We didn&rsquo;t know there were different types of &ldquo;links&rdquo;. In general, we were under the impression that all &ldquo;links&rdquo; on the web were just places that navigate different websites. In learning about this, we found out that internal links are those that take you to places within the same domain, and external links would link you outside of the website. For example, clicking on a link that takes you to Google from our website, is considered an external link.</li>
  <li>One thing we are still not clear on is why there is a whole tag dedicated to &lt;nav&gt;. It doesn&rsquo;t seem very intuitive to have an entire tag represent this, and we&rsquo;re not entirely sure why you would want to wrap it up in this tag, when you can just use headers or section tags, or even divs, to represent the navigation bar.</li>
  <li>We were initially confused about how onmousewheel differs from onscroll. We then found that the difference is that the former only fires when you physically scroll using your mouse or trackpad. Onscroll fires as well but also when scrolling with the arrow keys, the page up/down keys, etc.</li>
  <li>There were more event attributes that sounded like they do the same thing to us. After researching these, we found that some events, like onmouseover and onmouseout also fire when their child element gets triggered. This is what distinguishes them from similar event attributes, respectively onmouseenter and onmouseleave. Other than that, they actually do the same thing.</li>
